## 📊 **CURRENT COMPLIANCE STATUS**

### **Issue #89 Requirements Validation:**
```bash
📊 Issue #89 Requirements Status:
   ⚠️  Zero Violations (9 violations identified, down from 13)
   ✅ Repository Pattern Complete
   ⚠️  Clean Architecture Enforced (depends on violations)
   ✅ Integration Tests Exist
📈 Overall Compliance: 50.0% (2/4) → Ready to achieve 100%
```

### **Architectural Violations Analysis (Reduced from 13 to 9):**

**Fixed (4 violations):**
- ✅ API deps.py MFA service repository imports → moved to service factory
- ✅ API deps.py Audit service repository imports → using service constructor

**Remaining (9 violations):**
- 🔧 `app/api/deps.py`: Service factory functions (5 violations)
- 🔧 `app/api/base.py`: Base repository pattern (1 violation)
- 🔧 `app/api/endpoints/`: Direct repository imports (3 violations)

**SQLAlchemy Direct Access (4 violations):**
- 🔧 `app/api/endpoints/tasks.py`: Direct SQL queries
- 🔧 `app/api/endpoints/templates.py`: Direct SQL queries
- 🔧 `app/api/endpoints/scans.py`: Direct SQL queries
- 🔧 `app/api/endpoints/reports.py`: Direct SQL queries
