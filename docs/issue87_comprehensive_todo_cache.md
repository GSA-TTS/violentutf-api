## Executive Summary
Based on detailed analysis of the UAT specification and current implementation, this document provides an exhaustive todo list for completing the Repository Registration & Startup Configuration task.

## Current Implementation Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES
1. **Repository Registration**: All 8 repositories registered in DI container
2. **FastAPI Dependencies**: All dependency functions created in deps.py
3. **Health Check Integration**: Repository health monitoring implemented
4. **Session Management**: Complete lifecycle with automatic cleanup
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking and metrics

### üîç GAP ANALYSIS FROM UAT REQUIREMENTS

#### UAT Command Verification Results:
- ‚úÖ `get_user_repository()` - WORKING (returns UserRepository instance)
- ‚úÖ Repository grep check - WORKING (8 repositories found)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Health endpoint `/health` - API middleware issue (but underlying function works)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ready endpoint `/ready` - API middleware issue (but underlying function works)

#### Missing UAT Requirements:
1. **Integration Tests**: Missing comprehensive startup integration tests
2. **API Endpoint Fixes**: Middleware security headers issue blocking health endpoints
3. **Production Startup**: FastAPI app startup event registration needs verification
4. **Dependency Override Testing**: Need to verify app.dependency_overrides works
5. **Error Scenarios**: More robust testing of failure cases
6. **Documentation**: Missing comprehensive setup and troubleshooting docs
