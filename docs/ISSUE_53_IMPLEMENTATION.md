- **HTML Reports**: Interactive web-based reports with charts and visualizations
- **Charts**: Automation trends, security incident trends, ROI breakdowns
- **Executive Summary**: Auto-generated based on metrics
- **Recommendations**: Smart recommendations based on metric analysis

### 3. Scheduled Report Service (`app/services/scheduled_report_service.py`)

Enables automated report generation:

- **Cron-based Scheduling**: Support for any cron expression
- **Multiple Formats**: Generate reports in PDF, HTML, or both
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic email delivery with download links
- **Schedule Management**: Create, update, delete, and monitor schedules
- **Execution History**: Track all generated reports per schedule

### 4. API Endpoints (`app/api/endpoints/architectural_metrics.py`)

RESTful API for accessing metrics and reports:

```
GET  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/leading-indicators
GET  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/lagging-indicators
GET  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/roi-analysis
POST /api/v1/metrics/architectural/generate-report
POST /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedule
GET  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules
PUT  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}
GET  /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}/history
POST /api/v1/metrics/architectural/execute-schedules
```

### 5. Email Notifications (`app/utils/email.py`)

Email utility functions for report notifications:

- **Report Notifications**: Send emails when reports are ready
- **Failure Notifications**: Alert on report generation failures
- **HTML Email Templates**: Professional formatted emails
- **Multiple Recipients**: Support for TO, CC, BCC

### 6. Celery Task (`app/celery/tasks.py`)

Background task for scheduled report execution:

```python
@celery_app.task
async def execute_scheduled_reports_task()
```

This task can be scheduled with Celery Beat to run periodically (e.g., hourly) to check for and execute due scheduled reports.

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=password
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com

```

### Celery Beat Configuration

Add to your Celery Beat schedule:

```python
from celery.schedules import crontab

CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    'execute-scheduled-reports': {
        'task': 'app.celery.tasks.execute_scheduled_reports_task',
        'schedule': crontab(minute='0'),  # Run every hour
    },
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests are provided in `tests/test_issue_53.py`:

- `TestArchitecturalMetricsService`: Tests for metrics calculations
- `TestArchitecturalReportGenerator`: Tests for report generation
- `TestScheduledReportService`: Tests for scheduled reports
- `TestAcceptanceCriteria`: Validation of all acceptance criteria
- `TestDataValidation`: Data integrity and edge cases
- `TestHelperFunctions`: Utility function tests

## Usage Examples

### 1. Get Leading Indicators

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/api/v1/metrics/architectural/leading-indicators?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### 2. Generate ROI Report

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/v1/metrics/architectural/generate-report?format=pdf&include_roi=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### 3. Create Scheduled Report

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedule" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Weekly Metrics Report",
    "cron_expression": "0 9 * * MON",
    "formats": ["pdf", "html"],
    "notification_emails": ["team@example.com"],
    "period_days": 7
  }'
```

## Data Flow

1. **Metrics Collection**: Services query database for scan, vulnerability, and task data
2. **Metrics Calculation**: Leading/lagging indicators and ROI computed from raw data
3. **Report Generation**: Metrics formatted into PDF/HTML with charts and tables
4. **Scheduling**: Cron expressions determine when reports run automatically
5. **Notification**: Emails sent to stakeholders with download links

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Schedule management requires `reports.schedule` permission
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated with Pydantic models
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **Email Security**: SMTP with TLS, sanitized email content

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: 1-hour cache TTL for frequently accessed metrics
- **Async Operations**: All database operations use async SQLAlchemy
- **Background Tasks**: Report generation runs in Celery workers
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple metrics calculated in parallel

## Monitoring

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

- **Info Level**: Successful operations, report generation, email sending
- **Warning Level**: Missing configurations, degraded functionality
- **Error Level**: Failed operations, exceptions, critical issues

Monitor these log patterns:
- `"User {username} retrieved {metric_type} indicators"`
- `"Scheduled report execution completed: {successful} successful, {failed} failed"`
- `"Report generated successfully: {report_id}"`
- `"Email sent successfully to {recipients}"`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time metrics dashboard
2. **Custom Metrics**: User-defined KPIs and calculations
3. **Benchmarking**: Industry comparison metrics
4. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based trend predictions
5. **Export Formats**: Excel, CSV, JSON exports
6. **Report Templates**: Customizable report layouts
7. **Drill-down Reports**: Detailed breakdowns of specific metrics
8. **Mobile App**: Push notifications and mobile report viewing

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully delivers all acceptance criteria for Issue #53, providing comprehensive success metrics and ROI tracking for architectural audit initiatives. The solution is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, testing, and documentation.
