## Context

Following the implementation of the Repository Pattern (ADR-013), the ViolentUTF API requires a comprehensive unit testing strategy to achieve high-quality, maintainable code with robust test coverage. The current testing infrastructure has several gaps:

1. **Incomplete Repository Coverage**: Only 3 of 8 core repositories have comprehensive unit tests
2. **Service Layer Testing Gaps**: Services lack proper unit tests using repository interface mocks
3. **Inconsistent Test Patterns**: Mixed testing approaches across the codebase
4. **Low Coverage Metrics**: Repository layer coverage <80%, Service layer coverage <70%
5. **Slow Test Execution**: Current tests take >5 minutes due to database dependencies

**Issue #88 Requirements**: Implement comprehensive unit testing achieving >98% repository coverage and >95% service coverage with execution time <5 minutes.

**Architectural Violations**: Current testing patterns violate separation of concerns by mixing unit tests with database integration tests, making tests slow and brittle.

## Considered Options

### 1. Status Quo (Mixed Integration/Unit Tests)
Continue with current testing approach mixing unit and integration testing patterns.

* **Pros**:
    * No immediate refactoring required
    * Existing test infrastructure familiar to team
    * Some test coverage already exists
* **Cons**:
    * **Slow Execution**: Tests take >5 minutes due to database dependencies
    * **Low Coverage**: Repository <80%, Service <70% coverage
    * **Brittle Tests**: Database dependencies make tests flaky
    * **Poor Isolation**: Tests affect each other through shared database state
    * **Difficult Debugging**: Mixed concerns make test failures hard to diagnose

### 2. Pure Integration Testing Approach
Focus on end-to-end integration tests without isolated unit tests.

* **Pros**:
    * High confidence in system behavior
    * Tests actual database interactions
    * Simulates real production scenarios
* **Cons**:
    * **Slow Feedback**: Long test execution times
    * **Complex Setup**: Requires database fixtures and cleanup
    * **Test Coupling**: Tests dependent on database state
    * **Limited Coverage**: Hard to test edge cases and error conditions
    * **Maintenance Overhead**: Database changes break multiple tests

### 3. Comprehensive Unit Testing with Interface Mocking
Implement isolated unit tests for repository and service layers with comprehensive mocking strategy.

* **Pros**:
    * **Fast Execution**: Tests run in milliseconds without database dependencies
    * **High Coverage**: Can test all code paths including error conditions
    * **Isolation**: Tests are independent and can run in parallel
    * **Focused Testing**: Each test validates specific business logic
    * **Easy Debugging**: Clear test scope makes failures easy to diagnose
    * **Maintainable**: Tests remain stable when database schemas change
* **Cons**:
    * **Mock Maintenance**: Mocks must stay synchronized with interfaces
    * **False Confidence**: Mocked behavior might not match real implementation
    * **Initial Setup Cost**: Requires comprehensive test fixtures and utilities

## Decision

The ViolentUTF API will adopt **Comprehensive Unit Testing with Interface Mocking** (Option 3) for repository and service layers. This decision mandates:

1. **Repository Unit Testing**: Complete unit test coverage for all 8 core repositories using AsyncSession mocks
2. **Service Unit Testing**: Comprehensive service tests using repository interface mocks
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Shared fixtures, utilities, and mock objects for consistent testing
4. **Coverage Enforcement**: >98% repository coverage, >95% service coverage
5. **Performance Standards**: Unit test suite execution <5 minutes
6. **Parallel Execution**: Tests designed for safe parallel execution

## Rationale

1. **Performance Requirements**: Issue #88 mandates <5 minutes execution time, which is only achievable through isolated unit testing without database dependencies

2. **Coverage Goals**: >98% repository and >95% service coverage requires testing error conditions and edge cases that are difficult to reproduce with integration tests

3. **Repository Pattern Alignment**: The repository pattern (ADR-013) with interface contracts enables clean mocking strategies for isolated unit testing

4. **Developer Productivity**: Fast feedback loops are essential for TDD practices and continuous development

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**: Quick unit tests enable faster build pipelines and more frequent deployments

6. **Test Reliability**: Isolated tests eliminate flakiness caused by database state dependencies

7. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Unit tests are easier to maintain and debug than complex integration tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Foundation (Week 1)

**Repository Test Fixtures**:
```python
# tests/fixtures/repository_fixtures.py
@pytest.fixture
async def mock_session():
    """Provide AsyncSession mock for repository testing."""
    session = AsyncMock(spec=AsyncSession)
    return session

@pytest.fixture
def user_factory():
    """Factory for creating User test instances."""
    def _create_user(**kwargs):
        defaults = {
            'id': str(uuid.uuid4()),
            'username': 'testuser',
            'email': 'test@example.com',
            'is_active': True
        }
        defaults.update(kwargs)
        return User(**defaults)
    return _create_user
```

**Mock Repository Utilities**:
```python
# tests/utils/mock_repositories.py
class MockUserRepository:
    """Mock implementation of IUserRepository for service testing."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}
        self.call_log = []

    async def get_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
        self.call_log.append(('get_by_username', username))
        return self.users.get(username)
```

### Phase 2: Repository Unit Tests Implementation (Week 2-3)

**8 Core Repositories with Comprehensive Coverage**:

1. **UserRepository** - Authentication, user management, organization filtering
2. **SessionRepository** - Session lifecycle, token management, cleanup
3. **ApiKeyRepository** - Key generation, validation, rotation, organization scoping
4. **AuditRepository** - Log creation, querying, retention, performance optimization
5. **SecurityScanRepository** - Scan management, results storage, status tracking
6. **VulnerabilityRepository** - Finding management, classification, remediation tracking
7. **RoleRepository** - RBAC operations, permission management, inheritance
8. **HealthRepository** - System health checks, metrics collection, alerting

**Test Structure Example**:
```python
# tests/unit/repositories/test_user_repository.py
class TestUserRepository:
    """Comprehensive tests for UserRepository implementation."""

    async def test_get_by_username_success(self, user_repository, mock_session):
        """Test successful user retrieval by username."""

    async def test_get_by_username_not_found(self, user_repository, mock_session):
        """Test user not found scenario."""

    async def test_authenticate_valid_credentials(self, user_repository, mock_session):
        """Test successful authentication with valid credentials."""

    async def test_authenticate_database_error(self, user_repository, mock_session):
        """Test authentication with database connection error."""
```

### Phase 3: Service Unit Tests Implementation (Week 3-4)

**Service Testing with Repository Mocks**:
- Update existing service tests to use repository interface mocks
- Remove database dependencies from service layer tests
- Test service orchestration and business logic independently
- Cover error propagation and handling patterns

**Example Service Test**:
```python
# tests/unit/services/test_user_service.py
async def test_create_user_success(self, user_service, mock_user_repo):
    """Test successful user creation through service layer."""
    # Arrange
    mock_user_repo.is_username_available.return_value = True
    mock_user_repo.create_user.return_value = User(...)

    # Act
    result = await user_service.create_user(username="test", email="test@example.com")

    # Assert
    assert result.username == "test"
    mock_user_repo.is_username_available.assert_called_once_with("test")
    mock_user_repo.create_user.assert_called_once()
```

### Phase 4: Coverage Analysis and Optimization (Week 4)

**Coverage Tools and Reporting**:
```bash
# Coverage execution commands
pytest tests/unit/repositories/ --cov=app/repositories --cov-report=html
pytest tests/unit/services/ --cov=app/services --cov-report=html

# Combined coverage reporting
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=app/repositories --cov=app/services --cov-fail-under=95
```

**Performance Optimization**:
- Implement efficient mock objects to minimize test setup time
- Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- Optimize fixture loading and teardown
- Implement test result caching where appropriate

### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration and Quality Gates (Week 5)

**Quality Gates**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/unit-tests.yml
coverage_thresholds:
  repositories: 98%
  services: 95%
  overall: 95%

performance_limits:
  max_execution_time: 300s  # 5 minutes
  parallel_workers: 4
```

**Architectural Compliance**:
```python
# tests/architecture/test_unit_test_compliance.py
def test_repository_tests_use_mocks():
    """Ensure repository tests use AsyncSession mocks only."""

def test_service_tests_use_repository_mocks():
    """Ensure service tests use repository interface mocks only."""
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Repository Unit Tests

**Coverage Requirements**:
- All interface methods must have tests (100% method coverage)
- All error conditions must be tested
- All business logic branches must be covered
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting logic must be tested
- Input validation and sanitization must be tested

**Test Categories per Repository**:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete with various inputs
2. **Query Operations**: Complex queries, filtering, pagination, sorting
3. **Business Logic**: Domain-specific operations and validations
4. **Error Handling**: Database exceptions, constraint violations, timeouts
5. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, null inputs, empty results

### Service Unit Tests

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Use `AsyncMock` for repository interfaces
- Mock external service dependencies
- Test service orchestration logic independently
- Verify correct repository method calls and parameters

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- All service public methods (100% method coverage)
- All business logic branches
- Error handling and propagation patterns
- Service coordination and transaction boundaries

### Test Utilities and Fixtures

**Shared Fixtures**:
```python
# Async session mocks
# Domain model factories
# Repository mock implementations
# Common test data builders
# Error condition simulators
```

**Test Organization**:
- Parallel test structure to production code
- Consistent naming conventions (test_{method_name}_{scenario})
- Grouped test classes for related functionality
- Descriptive test names following Given-When-Then pattern
