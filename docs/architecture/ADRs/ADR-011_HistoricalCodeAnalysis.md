* DevOps and Platform Operations Team

## Context

As part of the ADR Compliance Architectural Audit Implementation (Epic #40), the audit team requires systematic tooling to identify architectural violation hotspots across the codebase. Manual code review alone is insufficient for identifying patterns of ADR violations at scale, particularly when analyzing historical trends and prioritizing remediation efforts.

The audit process needs to move beyond point-in-time static analysis to understand the temporal patterns of architectural violations, identify persistent problem areas, and track remediation effectiveness over time. This requires automated analysis of Git commit history to detect when architectural fixes are applied, correlating these with specific ADR violations, and generating risk-based prioritization for audit focus areas.

Furthermore, with 20+ ADRs in place covering everything from authentication strategies (ADR-002) to logging standards (ADR-008), manual correlation between code changes and ADR compliance has become a scalability bottleneck that requires systematic automation.

## Decision

The ViolentUTF API will implement a **Historical Code Analysis Tool** (`tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py`) that provides automated ADR compliance auditing through Git history forensics.

### Core Architecture Components:

1. **Git History Parser**: PyDriller-based commit analysis with conventional commits support
2. **ADR Pattern Matcher**: Configurable pattern recognition engine for violation detection
3. **Multi-Factor Risk Scorer**: Advanced hotspot identification using frequency, recency, severity, and complexity
4. **Report Generator**: Comprehensive Markdown reports with actionable recommendations
5. **Security Layer**: Input validation, path traversal protection, and resource limits

### Key Design Principles:

1. **Pattern-Driven Detection**: YAML-configurable violation patterns mapped to specific ADRs
2. **Multi-Layer Analysis**: File patterns, diff patterns, and source code content analysis
3. **Temporal Risk Weighting**: Recent violations weighted higher than historical ones
4. **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive input validation and resource protection
5. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, parallel processing, and efficient algorithms

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Architecture

```
tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py
├── ConventionalCommitParser     # Commit message parsing
├── ADRPatternMatcher           # Violation pattern detection
├── ComplexityAnalyzer          # Cyclomatic complexity analysis
├── HistoricalAnalyzer          # Main orchestration engine
└── ReportGenerator             # Markdown report generation
```

### Configuration System

```
config/violation_patterns.yml
├── Core ADRs (ADR-001 to ADR-010)
├── Feature ADRs (ADR-F1.1 to ADR-F4.2)
├── Security ADRs (ADR-SEC-001, ADR-SEC-002)
└── General Patterns (GENERAL-SECURITY, MIDDLEWARE-VIOLATIONS)
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

The tool implements a sophisticated multi-factor risk scoring model:

```
Risk Score = (Frequency × RecencyWeight) × SeverityWeight × ComplexityScore
```

**With logarithmic normalization for scores > 100:**
```
Normalized Score = 100 + log₁₀(base_score / 100) × 20
```

**Factors:**
- **Frequency**: Raw violation count per file in analysis window
- **Recency Weight**: Linear decay from 1.0 (today) to 0.1 (window edge)
- **Severity Weight**: ADR-specific impact multipliers (0.7 to 1.6)
- **Complexity Score**: Average cyclomatic complexity from static analysis

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Standard 6-month analysis
python3 tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py . --days 180

# Focused recent analysis with custom output
python3 tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py . --days 30 \
  --output reports/recent_violations.md --verbose

# Custom exclusions and JSON export
python3 tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py . \
  --exclude "*.test.py" --exclude "mock_*" \
  --json-output analysis_data.json
```

### Report Generation

The tool generates comprehensive reports with descriptive naming:
- **Format**: `ADRaudit_{TopViolatedADR}Violations_{CommitCount}commits_{FileCount}files_{Date}.md`
- **Example**: `ADRaudit_002Violations_11commits_100files_20250731.md`

**Report Contents:**
- Executive summary with key findings
- Top 20 high-risk files with risk scores
- Detailed file analysis for high-risk items (Risk Score > 5.0)
- ADR violation summary and rankings
- Actionable recommendations for immediate and medium-term actions
- Methodology documentation for transparency

## Integration with Existing ADRs

### Primary ADR Dependencies

**ADR-008 (Logging and Auditing)**:

### Violation Detection Coverage

The tool specifically detects violations across all implemented ADRs:

**Authentication (ADR-002)**:
- JWT algorithm weaknesses (non-RS256)
- Token validation failures
- Authentication middleware issues

**Rate Limiting (ADR-005)**:
- Missing rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
- Token bucket implementation issues
- Organization-based limiting violations

**Logging (ADR-008)**:
- Non-structured logging patterns
- Missing correlation IDs
- PII exposure in logs

**[Additional coverage for all 20+ ADRs through configurable patterns]**

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Path traversal protection for all file operations
- Repository path validation with Git structure verification
- Configuration file validation with YAML security checks
- Parameter bounds checking (analysis window: 1-3650 days)
