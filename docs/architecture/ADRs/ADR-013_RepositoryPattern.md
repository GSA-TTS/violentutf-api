## Context
The ViolentUTF API codebase currently exhibits 243 identified violations where services and API endpoints access the database directly through SQLAlchemy sessions. This direct database access pattern creates several architectural issues:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Services and API endpoints are tightly coupled to specific database implementations and SQLAlchemy ORM details
2. **Poor Testability**: Unit testing is difficult due to direct database dependencies requiring complex mocking
3. **Code Duplication**: Common database operations are duplicated across multiple service classes
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Database errors are handled inconsistently across the codebase
5. **Transaction Management**: Transaction boundaries are unclear and inconsistently applied
6. **Security Concerns**: Direct database access increases the risk of SQL injection and data exposure

The PyTestArch framework has identified these violations across:
- 31 service files with direct database access (100 violations)
- 20+ API endpoints with direct database operations (144 violations)

This architectural debt makes the codebase harder to maintain, test, and secure. A systematic approach to abstract database access behind a repository layer is required to address these concerns.

## Considered Options

### 1. Status Quo (Direct Database Access)
Continue with the current pattern where services and APIs directly use SQLAlchemy sessions.

* **Pros**:
    * No immediate development effort required
    * Developers familiar with existing patterns
    * Direct access provides maximum flexibility
* **Cons**:
    * **Architectural Debt**: 243 violations indicate significant technical debt
    * **Poor Testability**: Unit tests require database setup or complex mocking
    * **Code Duplication**: Common database operations repeated across codebase
    * **Tight Coupling**: Services coupled to specific ORM implementation
    * **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Database errors handled differently across services
    * **Security Risk**: Direct database access increases attack surface

### 2. Active Record Pattern
Implement domain models with embedded database access methods.

* **Pros**:
    * Simple to implement and understand
    * Domain objects contain their own persistence logic
    * Reduces external dependencies
* **Cons**:
    * **Tight Coupling**: Models tightly coupled to database implementation
    * **Testing Difficulties**: Models become difficult to unit test
    * **SRP Violation**: Models handle both business logic and persistence
    * **Limited Flexibility**: Hard to change persistence strategies

### 3. Repository Pattern with Interfaces
Implement a comprehensive repository layer with interface contracts and dependency injection.

* **Pros**:
    * **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between business logic and data access
    * **Testability**: Repositories can be easily mocked for unit testing
    * **Consistency**: Standardized approach to database operations
    * **Flexibility**: Can change underlying persistence implementation
    * **Error Handling**: Centralized and consistent error handling
    * **Transaction Management**: Clear transaction boundaries
    * **Code Reusability**: Common CRUD operations implemented once
* **Cons**:
    * **Initial Complexity**: Requires significant refactoring effort
    * **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand repository pattern
    * **Abstraction Overhead**: Additional layer may impact performance slightly

## Decision
The ViolentUTF API will adopt the **Repository Pattern with Interfaces** for all data access operations. This decision mandates:

1. **Base Repository Implementation**: A generic base repository class providing common CRUD operations with async support
2. **Interface Contracts**: Repository interfaces for each domain entity (User, Session, ApiKey, Audit, etc.)
3. **Dependency Injection**: A container-based approach for repository dependency management
4. **Service Layer Refactoring**: All services must use repository interfaces instead of direct database access
5. **API Layer Cleanup**: API endpoints must only call service methods, eliminating direct database operations
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Repository layer tested with >98% coverage, service layer with >95% coverage

---
## Rationale

1. **Architectural Compliance**: The primary driver is eliminating the 243 identified architectural violations and preventing future violations through enforced patterns

2. **Improved Testability**: Repository interfaces can be easily mocked, enabling true unit testing of service logic without database dependencies

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between business logic (services) and data access (repositories) improves code organization and maintainability

4. **Consistency**: Standardized data access patterns across the entire codebase with consistent error handling and transaction management

5. **Security Enhancement**: Centralized data access reduces the attack surface and enables consistent security controls (input validation, query parameterization)

6. **Future Flexibility**: Repository abstraction enables easier migration to different databases or persistence strategies without business logic changes

7. **Code Quality**: Eliminates code duplication and provides reusable, tested data access components

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Repository Infrastructure Foundation
- Create enhanced base repository with generic CRUD operations
- Define repository interface contracts for all domain entities
- Implement dependency injection container for repository management

### Phase 2: Core Entity Repositories
- Implement repositories for high-priority entities (User, Session, ApiKey, Audit)
- Focus on services with highest violation counts first
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 3: Service Layer Refactoring
- Refactor 31 service files to use repository interfaces
- Prioritize services with most violations: MFA Policy (22), User (18), Health (15)
- Remove direct database access from service methods

### Phase 4: API Layer Cleanup
- Update 20+ API endpoints to eliminate direct database operations
- Ensure API endpoints only call service methods
- Implement consistent DTO patterns for API responses

### Phase 5: Integration and Validation
- Comprehensive testing with architectural compliance validation
- Performance benchmarking to ensure <5% latency increase
- PyTestArch validation showing 0 violations

## Consequences

* **Positive**:
    * **Zero Architectural Violations**: Elimination of all 243 identified violations
    * **Improved Testability**: Services can be unit tested without database dependencies
    * **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation between layers with consistent patterns
    * **Enhanced Security**: Centralized data access with consistent security controls
    * **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common database operations implemented once and reused
    * **Future Flexibility**: Easy to change persistence strategies or add caching layers

* **Negative**:
    * **Initial Development Effort**: Significant refactoring required across 31+ files
    * **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand repository pattern and dependency injection
    * **Slight Performance Overhead**: Additional abstraction layer may add minimal latency
    * **Increased Complexity**: More interfaces and classes to maintain

* **Technical Impact**:
    * All services must be refactored to use dependency injection
    * API endpoints must be updated to eliminate direct database access
    * Comprehensive test suite required for repository layer
    * PyTestArch rules must be updated to enforce repository pattern
    * CI/CD pipeline must validate architectural compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **PyTestArch Compliance**: 0 violations (down from 243)
2. **Test Coverage**: Repository layer >98%, Service layer >95%
3. **Performance**: <5% latency increase from baseline
4. **API Compatibility**: All existing API functionality preserved
5. **Code Quality**: All linting and type checking passes with zero violations
