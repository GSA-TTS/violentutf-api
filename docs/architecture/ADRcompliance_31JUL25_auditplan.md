# **Enhanced ADR Compliance Audit: Implementation Plan**

**Version:** 31JUL25 (Revision 1.1)
**Author:** Tam Nguyen (Cybonto)
**Project:** ViolentUTF-API Architectural Audit
**Status:** **Draft for Final Review**

---

## **Executive Summary**

This document presents a comprehensive, enhanced implementation plan for conducting an architectural audit of the ViolentUTF-API codebase. Its purpose is to ensure strict adherence to the documented Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and to establish a sustainable governance model.

This revision incorporates a rigorous risk assessment framework, a multi-layered hybrid audit methodology including AI-augmented analysis, a formal architectural debt management process, and a stronger focus on creating durable, automated compliance checks. The goal is not just a point-in-time audit but the foundation for **continuous architectural compliance**.

### **Audit Objectives**

1.  **Validate ADR Compliance**: Ensure the main codebase strictly adheres to all 22 documented ADRs.
2.  **Identify and Quantify Architectural Debt**: Discover, document, and prioritize all compliance gaps as a formal "architectural debt" backlog.
3.  **Establish Continuous Governance**: Implement and enhance Architecture-as-Code test cases, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, to prevent future architectural drift.

---

## **Section 1: Audit Preparation and Scoping**

A thorough preparation phase is the single most important predictor of a successful audit.

### **1.1 In-Scope and Out-of-Scope**

#### **In-Scope Components**

* **Core Application & Security**: All modules within `app/`, including the full middleware stack and security components.
* **Database and Data Layer**: All data models, repositories, and the polyglot persistence strategy (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: CI/CD pipelines, dependency management (`pyproject.toml`), and container configurations related to security sandboxing.
* **All 22 Architectural Decision Records**: Both foundational (ADR-001 to ADR-010) and feature-specific (F-series) ADRs.

#### **Out-of-Scope Components**

* **Third-party Dependency Internals**: The internal architecture of third-party libraries is out of scope, but their usage and configuration are in scope per **ADR-010**.
* **Downstream Log Aggregation/Monitoring Tools**: The audit will verify that the API *produces* correct structured logs and metrics, but not the configuration of the external systems that consume them (e.g., Splunk, Datadog).

### **1.2 ADR Risk Assessment and Prioritization**

This enhanced risk assessment uses the methodology from the audit playbook, scoring the **Likelihood** of a violation and its **Business Impact** to produce a clear priority score.

| ADR | Title | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score (L x I) | Audit Priority & Focus |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ADR-F4.1** | **Container-based Sandboxing** | 3 | 5 | **25** | **CRITICAL**: Validate sandbox integrity and isolation. Any weakness poses a direct RCE risk. |
| **ADR-F4.2** | **Centralized Secrets Management** | 3 | 5 | **25** | **CRITICAL**: Ensure no secrets are stored outside the dedicated manager and that JIT retrieval is correctly implemented. |
| **ADR-003** | **RBAC+ABAC Authorization** | 2 | 5 | **25** | **CRITICAL**: Validate that multi-tenant data isolation is flawlessly enforced across all endpoints. |
| **ADR-F1.1** | **Sandboxed Templating Engine** | 4 | 4 | **16** | **HIGH**: Validate the Jinja2 sandbox cannot be bypassed (SSTI risk). |
| **ADR-010** | **Dependency Management / SCA** | 4 | 4 | **16** | **HIGH**: Ensure the SCA tooling is correctly configured and blocking builds as specified. |
| **ADR-005** | **Rate Limiting** | 3 | 4 | **12** | **HIGH**: Validate that resource-intensive endpoints have stricter limits and that Redis is used for state. |
| **ADR-007** | **Async Task Processing** | 2 | 5 | **10** | **HIGH**: Verify the integrity of the Celery/Redis backend and test webhook security. |
| **ADR-002** | **Authentication Strategy** | 2 | 5 | **10** | **HIGH**: Audit the JWT implementation, key management, and token revocation mechanism. |
| **ADR-008** | **Logging/Auditing** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **MEDIUM**: Validate that logs are structured correctly and, most importantly, that sensitive data is redacted. |
| **ADR-009** | **Error Handling (RFC 7807)** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **MEDIUM**: Ensure no internal details or stack traces are leaked in production error responses. |
| **ADR-F2.2**| **Polyglot Persistence** | 2 | 4 | **8** | **MEDIUM**: Focus on validating the data lifecycle logic and consistency between data stores. |
| **ADR-F1.2**| **Server-Side Orchestration** | 3 | 3 | **9** | **MEDIUM**: Validate the state machine execution engine for correctness and resource handling. |
| **ADR-001**| **REST API Style** | 2 | 2 | **4** | **LOW**: Create fitness functions for naming conventions and URI structure. |

*(Note: Other ADRs will be validated but are considered lower risk and will be primarily covered by automated checks.)*

### **1.3 Assembling the Audit Team**

The audit will be conducted by a cross-functional team as recommended in the playbook.

* **Audit Lead** (Senior Architect)
* **Senior Developers (2)** (With deep codebase context)
* **Security Analyst (1)** (Focused on security ADRs like sandboxing and secrets)
* **DevOps/SRE Engineer (1)** (Focused on CI/CD, IaC, and monitoring integration)

Note: for early rounds of audit, the team will be me and my AI agents.
---

## **Section 2: Hybrid Audit Execution Methodology**

The audit will employ a hybrid approach, combining manual review for intent and nuance with automated analysis for speed and scale.

### **2.1 Manual Architectural Review**

Focused review sessions will be conducted for the **CRITICAL** and **HIGH** priority ADRs.

* **Format**: 90-minute "Architecture-focused peer reviews" per ADR.
* **Structure**:
    1.  **ADR Recap (10 min)**: Review the decision and its rationale.
    2.  **Code Presentation (30 min)**: The component owner demonstrates how the implementation complies with the ADR.
    3.  **Guided Questioning & Attack Simulation (40 min)**: The audit team will probe the implementation and simulate attack scenarios.
        * *For ADR-F4.1 (Sandboxing)*: "Submit a model with a malicious loading script. Demonstrate that it cannot access the network or the host filesystem."
        * *For ADR-003 (Authorization)*: "Using a valid token from Tenant A, demonstrate that it is impossible to access any resource from Tenant B."
    4.  **Findings Documentation (10 min)**: All identified gaps are recorded immediately.

Of course. Here is a detailed expansion of Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the ADR Compliance Audit Implementation Plan, integrating best practices and specific examples from the provided architectural documentation.

-----

### **2.2 Automated Analysis Framework (Expanded)**

Automated analysis provides the speed, scale, and repeatability necessary to audit a complex codebase efficiently. It excels at finding concrete, well-defined violations of the rules established in the ADRs. This framework will be implemented as a mandatory, blocking quality gate in the CI/CD pipeline.

#### **2.2.1 Static Architecture Compliance (PyTestArch)**

These fitness functions act as unit tests for the architecture, providing the primary defense against structural decay and dependency violations. We will expand the existing test suite with targeted tests for specific ADRs.

**Example 1: Enforcing ADR-003 (Hybrid Authorization Model)**
This test ensures that data repository methods, which directly interact with the database, are properly isolated by tenant.

```python
# tests/architecture/test_adr_003_authorization.py
import inspect
from app.repositories.base import BaseRepository
from app.core.security import GUEST_USER # A simulated user for testing

def test_all_repository_methods_enforce_tenant_isolation():
    """
    Validates that all data-fetching methods in every repository class
    mandate the inclusion of an authenticated principal, which contains
    the necessary `organization_id` for ABAC checks.
    """
    # Discover all repository classes inheriting from a common base
    all_repo_classes = [cls for cls in BaseRepository.__subclasses__()]
    violations = []

    for repo_class in all_repo_classes:
        # Inspect the signature of every method in the repository
        for method_name, method in inspect.getmembers(repo_class, predicate=inspect.isfunction):
            sig = inspect.signature(method)
            # The rule: Every method must have a 'current_user' parameter or similar
            # to pass the security context for ABAC filtering.
            if 'current_user' not in sig.parameters:
                violations.append(
                    f"Violation in {repo_class.__name__}.{method_name}: "
                    f"Method lacks a 'current_user' parameter, breaking the ABAC pattern from ADR-003."
                )

    assert not violations, f"Architectural violations found:\n" + "\n".join(violations)
```

**Example 2: Enforcing ADR-F4.2 (Centralized Secrets Management)**
This fitness function ensures no code outside the dedicated secrets management service attempts to handle raw credentials.

```python
# tests/architecture/test_adr_f4_2_secrets.py
from pytestarch import get_evaluable_architecture, Rule

def test_secret_handling_is_isolated():
    """
    Validates that only the 'secrets_client' module interacts with the
    secrets management backend, as mandated by ADR-F4.2.
    """
    evaluable = get_evaluable_architecture(
        "/path/to/project_root",
        "/path/to/project_root/src"
    )

    # The rule: No module except the secrets client itself is allowed to
    # import from the low-level secrets library (e.g., 'hvac' for Vault).
    rule = (
        Rule()
        .modules_that()
        .are_not_in_package("src.clients.secrets_client")
        .should_not()
        .depend_on_modules_that()
        .are_in_package("hvac") # Example library for HashiCorp Vault
    )

    rule.assert_applies(evaluable)
```

#### **2.2.2 Policy-as-Code (OPA)**

Policy-as-Code (PaC) using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its language Rego will be used to enforce rules that are difficult to express in Python tests, such as the structure of configuration files or API responses.

**Example: Enforcing ADR-009 (Standardized Error Handling with RFC 7807)**
This Rego policy can be run in the CI pipeline against the generated OpenAPI specification (`openapi.json`) to ensure all error responses comply with the standard.

```rego
package adr.compliance.adr009

# Default to compliant
default allow = true

# Rule: Deny if any error response (4xx or 5xx) does not conform to RFC 7807.
deny[msg] {
    # Find any path, any method, and any response code that is an error
    some path, method, code, response in input.paths
    to_number(code) >= 400

    # The rule: The content type for 'application/problem+json' must be defined.
    not response.content["application/problem+json"]

    msg := sprintf("Endpoint '%s %s' has a %s error response that does not comply with RFC 7807 (missing 'application/problem+json' content type), violating ADR-009.", [method, path, code])
}

# Rule: Deny if the RFC 7807 schema is missing required custom fields.
deny[msg] {
    some path, method, code, response in input.paths
    to_number(code) >= 400
    problem_schema := response.content["application/problem+json"].schema["$ref"]

    # The rule: The schema must define 'correlation_id' and 'error_code'.
    required_fields := {"correlation_id", "error_code"}
    schema_properties := input.components.schemas[get_schema_name(problem_schema)].properties
    provided_fields := {field | schema_properties[field]}
    missing_fields := required_fields - provided_fields

    count(missing_fields) > 0

    msg := sprintf("Endpoint '%s %s' has a %s error response whose schema is missing required fields %v, violating ADR-009.", [method, path, code, missing_fields])
}

get_schema_name(ref) = name {
    name := split(ref, "/")[_]
}
```

### **2.3 AI-Augmented Analysis (Expanded)**

To move beyond syntactic checks and audit the semantic *intent* of our ADRs, we will employ a two-pronged AI-augmented strategy.

#### **2.3.1 LLM-Powered Semantic Analysis with RAG**

This approach turns a Large Language Model into a project-specific architectural expert.

  * **1. Knowledge Base Creation**:

      * The complete text of all 22 ADRs and their associated documentation (like `ADRcompliance_Framework.md`) will be ingested.
      * Key source code files that implement these ADRs (e.g., `app/core/security.py`, `app/middleware/authorization.py`) will also be added.
      * These documents are chunked and converted into vector embeddings, creating a searchable knowledge base in a vector database that understands the semantic meaning of our architecture.

  * **2. Semantic Querying for Intent Verification**:
    The audit team will ask deep, intent-based questions that are impossible for traditional static analysis to answer.

      * **Query for ADR-F2.2 (Polyglot Persistence)**: *"Review the code in `app/services/data_lifecycle_manager.py`. According to the data lifecycle rules in ADR-F2.2, evidence should be moved from the 'hot' Document DB to 'cold' Blob Storage after 90 days. Does the logic in this file correctly implement this 90-day archival threshold, or is the retention period hard-coded to a different value?"*

      * **Query for ADR-F3.1 (Hybrid Scoring Architecture)**: *"ADR-F3.1 specifies a two-phase scoring system: lightweight 'triage' scorers and heavyweight 'deep analysis' scorers. Analyze the `ScorerPlugin` classes in `app/plugins/scorers/`. Identify any plugins marked as `SCORER_TYPE: 'real-time'` that appear to be computationally expensive (e.g., making external network calls or loading large models), which would violate the performance intent of the triage phase."*

  * **3. Grounded Generation for Trustworthy Answers**:
    The RAG system ensures the LLM's response is grounded in actual project data. When answering the query above, the LLM prompt is automatically augmented with the exact text from **ADR-F3.1** and the source code of the scorer plugins. This forces the model to reason based on facts from our repository, not its general training data, drastically reducing the risk of hallucination and providing a reliable, evidence-based analysis.

#### **2.3.2 Autonomous Agent Audit**

To proactively hunt for complex, multi-step vulnerabilities, we will pilot an autonomous agent framework. This simulates the cognitive workflow of a human expert.

**Goal**: "Verify that the system is not vulnerable to Broken Object Level Authorization, as per ADR-003."

**Simulated Agent Execution Flow**:

1.  **Initiator Agent**: The agent starts by identifying all API endpoints that accept a path parameter containing a resource ID (e.g., `/api/v1/scans/{scan_id}`). This scopes the audit to functions that perform object-level access.

2.  **Explorer Agent**: For each endpoint, the agent begins a demand-driven traversal of the code's call graph, starting from the route handler.

      * **Step 1**: It analyzes the endpoint's dependencies. It sees the `Depends(require_role("viewer"))` decorator and confirms the RBAC check from ADR-003 is present.
      * **Step 2**: It traces the `scan_id` and the `current_user` object into the service layer call (e.g., `scan_service.get_scan_by_id(scan_id, current_user)`).
      * **Step 3**: It follows the call into the repository layer (e.g., `scan_repository.get_by_id(scan_id, organization_id)`).
      * **Step 4 (Hypothetical Violation Detection)**: The agent analyzes the repository method. It prompts the LLM: "Analyze this function's SQLAlchemy query. Does the query use the `organization_id` in its `WHERE` clause to filter the results?" If the agent discovers a code path where the `organization_id` is *not* used, it flags a potential Broken Object Level Authorization vulnerability.

3.  **Validator Agent**: The agent then constructs a "proof." It generates a unit test that creates two scans in two different organizations, then calls the vulnerable endpoint as User A to request User B's scan. If the request succeeds (returning data instead of a 404), the agent confirms the vulnerability is real and not a hallucination, creating a high-fidelity audit finding.

---

## **Section 3: Gap Tracking and Architectural Debt Management**

Identified compliance gaps will be managed as a formal architectural debt backlog, not as simple bugs.

1.  **Gap Registry**: A dedicated Epic or new issue type named "ArchDebt" will be created. Each finding from the audit will be logged as a new issue in this registry.
2.  **Gap Classification**: Each issue will be classified using the system from the playbook, including:
    * **Finding ID & Description**
    * **ADR Violated**
    * **Risk Score** (from Section 1.2)
    * **Remediation Owner**
3.  **Prioritization Framework**: The backlog will be prioritized using the **Impact vs. Effort** matrix. High-impact, high-risk items (e.g., any flaw in sandboxing or tenant isolation) will be prioritized for immediate remediation.
4.  **Remediation Planning**: For each gap, a strategy will be defined:
    * **Incremental Refactoring**: The preferred approach for most issues.
    * **Large-Scale Remediation**: For systemic issues requiring a dedicated epic.
    * **Accept Risk**: In rare cases, if a fix is infeasible, the decision to accept the risk **must be documented in a new ADR** that supersedes the old one.

---

## **Section 4: Proactive Enforcement and Continuous Improvement**

The audit's ultimate goal is to create a self-correcting system.

1.  **Codifying New Fitness Functions**: The audit is not just about checking existing rules, but about expanding them. A key deliverable will be a set of new, automated fitness functions for every identified gap that can be tested automatically.
2.  **CI/CD Integration**: All new fitness functions and policy checks developed during the audit will be integrated into the main CI/CD pipeline as a **mandatory, blocking step**.
3.  **AI-Powered Monitoring (AIOps)**: As a forward-looking action item, we will create a plan to implement the AIOps monitoring described in the playbook. This involves identifying key architectural health metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, number of tenant isolation failures in tests) and feeding them into a tool to detect negative trends over time.

---

## **Section 5: Missing ADR Coverage Analysis**

### **5.1 Identified ADR Gaps**

Analysis of the current ADR repository reveals several critical gaps that should be addressed during the audit:

#### **Missing Core ADRs**
* **ADR-004**: Input Validation and Sanitization Strategy - Missing comprehensive decision on validation frameworks
* **ADR-006**: Caching Strategy - No formal decision on Redis usage patterns and cache invalidation
* **ADR-011**: Service-to-Service Communication - Missing decisions about internal API patterns
* **ADR-012**: Data Governance and PII Handling - Critical for compliance with privacy regulations

#### **Missing Integration ADRs**
* **I-001**: External Service Integration Patterns
* **I-002**: Webhook Security and Reliability
* **I-003**: Third-Party API Rate Limiting and Circuit Breaking

#### **Missing Operational ADRs**
* **O-001**: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
* **O-002**: Performance Monitoring and SLI/SLO Definitions
* **O-003**: Configuration Management Strategy

### **5.2 Prioritized ADR Development Plan**

These missing ADRs will be created during the audit process based on discovered patterns in the codebase:

| Priority | ADR | Rationale | Timeline |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------|
| Critical | ADR-004 | Input validation gaps found in middleware | Week 1 |
| Critical | ADR-012 | PII handling inconsistencies discovered | Week 2 |
| High | ADR-006 | Redis caching patterns need standardization | Week 3 |
| Medium | I-001 | External service calls lack consistent patterns | Week 4 |

---

## **Section 6: Enhanced Automated Analysis Framework**

### **6.1 PyTestArch Extensions**

Beyond the existing architectural tests, we will implement advanced structural validation:

#### **Dependency Cycle Prevention**
```python
# tests/architecture/test_circular_dependencies.py
import ast
import os
from typing import Dict, Set, List
from pytestarch import get_evaluable_architecture

def test_no_circular_dependencies_between_layers():
    """Prevent architectural spaghetti by detecting circular imports."""
    dependency_graph = build_dependency_graph("app/")
    cycles = detect_cycles(dependency_graph)

    assert not cycles, f"Circular dependencies detected: {cycles}"

def build_dependency_graph(root_path: str) -> Dict[str, Set[str]]:
    """Build a dependency graph from Python imports."""
    graph = {}
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                module_name = get_module_name(file_path)
                imports = extract_imports(file_path)
                graph[module_name] = imports
    return graph

def detect_cycles(graph: Dict[str, Set[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    """Detect cycles using DFS with color coding."""
    # Implementation using topological sort
    pass
```

#### **Security Pattern Enforcement**
```python
# tests/architecture/test_security_patterns.py
def test_sensitive_operations_require_authentication():
    """Ensure all endpoints modifying data require authentication."""
    from app.api import endpoints

    violations = []
    for endpoint_module in get_endpoint_modules():
        for route in extract_routes(endpoint_module):
            if route.methods & {'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'}:
                if not has_auth_dependency(route):
                    violations.append(f"{route.path} lacks authentication")

    assert not violations, f"Authentication violations: {violations}"

def test_database_queries_use_parameterization():
    """Prevent SQL injection by ensuring parameterized queries."""
    sql_patterns = find_sql_patterns("app/repositories/")
    violations = [pattern for pattern in sql_patterns if is_string_concatenation(pattern)]

    assert not violations, f"Potential SQL injection risks: {violations}"
```

### **6.2 Dynamic Security Testing Integration**

#### **Container Security Validation**
```python
# tests/security/test_container_security.py
import docker
import pytest
from app.core.sandbox import SandboxManager

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_container_sandbox_isolation():
    """Validate ADR-F4.1 container sandbox cannot access host resources."""
    client = docker.from_env()

    # Test network isolation
    result = run_in_sandbox("curl -s http://169.254.169.254/", timeout=5)
    assert result.returncode != 0, "Container should not access metadata service"

    # Test filesystem isolation
    result = run_in_sandbox("ls /proc/1/", timeout=5)
    assert "Permission denied" in result.stderr, "Container should not access host processes"

    # Test privilege escalation prevention
    result = run_in_sandbox("sudo whoami", timeout=5)
    assert result.returncode != 0, "Container should not allow privilege escalation"
```

#### **API Security Testing**
```python
# tests/security/test_api_security.py
@pytest.mark.security
class TestAuthorizationBypass:
    """Test suite for ADR-003 authorization bypass attempts."""

    def test_horizontal_privilege_escalation(self, test_client, user_tokens):
        """Test users cannot access other users' resources."""
        user_a_token, user_b_token = user_tokens

        # Create resource as user A
        response = test_client.post(
            "/api/v1/scans",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_a_token}"},
            json={"name": "test_scan"}
        )
        scan_id = response.json()["id"]

        # Attempt to access as user B
        response = test_client.get(
            f"/api/v1/scans/{scan_id}",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_b_token}"}
        )
        assert response.status_code == 404, "User B should not see User A's scan"
```
