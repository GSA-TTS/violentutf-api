# Architectural Violation Hotspots Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-07 10:54:02 UTC
**Repository:** `.`
**Analysis Period:** 1 days (since 2025-08-06)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes Git commit history to identify architectural violation hotspots - code areas with frequent architectural violations that require focused audit attention.

### Key Findings

- **Total Commits Analyzed:** 2
- **Violation Commits Found:** 0 (0.0% of all commits)
- **Files with Violations:** 0
- **Unique ADRs Violated:** 0

## Top 10 High-Risk Files

The following files represent the highest architectural risk based on a multi-factor risk score combining violation frequency, recency, severity, and code complexity:

| Rank | File Path | Risk Score | Violations | Complexity | Primary ADRs Violated |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|----------------------|

## Detailed File Analysis

### High-Risk Files (Risk Score > 5.0)

No files with risk score > 5.0 found.

## ADR Violation Summary

The following table shows which architectural decisions are being violated most frequently:

| ADR ID | ADR Name | Violation Count | Severity Weight | Description |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Focus Audit Efforts:** Prioritize manual review of the top 5 high-risk files listed above
2. **Refactoring Targets:** Consider breaking down complex files (complexity > 10) with high violation counts
3. **Pattern Analysis:** Investigate why certain ADRs are being violated most frequently

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Developer Training:** Focus on ADRs with highest violation counts
2. **Tooling Integration:** Implement pre-commit hooks to catch violations early
3. **Documentation Review:** Update ADR documentation for frequently violated principles

### Tracking Effectiveness

- **Baseline Established:** This report serves as the baseline for measuring improvement
- **Re-run Frequency:** Recommended monthly analysis to track trends
- **Success Metrics:** Target 20% reduction in high-risk files within 3 months

## Methodology

This analysis uses a multi-factor risk scoring model:

```
Risk Score = (Frequency × Recency Weight) × Severity Weight × Complexity Score
```

- **Frequency:** Total violation count in the analysis period
- **Recency Weight:** Decay factor giving more weight to recent violations (1.0 = today, 0.1 = 1 days ago)
- **Severity Weight:** ADR-specific impact multiplier (configured in violation_patterns.yml)
- **Complexity Score:** Average cyclomatic complexity from static analysis

Files are considered "hotspots" when they have both high violation frequency AND high complexity, indicating they are both unstable and difficult to maintain.
