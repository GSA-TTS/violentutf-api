# Pre-commit Fixes Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed all pre-commit issues. All checks are now passing ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Sorting (isort)
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_errors.py`
- **Issue**: Imports were not properly grouped
- **Fix**: Automatically fixed by isort hook

### 2. Type Annotations (mypy)
Fixed 15 mypy errors across 2 files:

#### app/db/types.py
- Added missing imports: `Dialect`, `TypeEngine` from SQLAlchemy
- Added type annotations to all methods:
  - `default()` method in CustomJSONEncoder
  - `load_dialect_impl()` in both GUID and JSONType classes
  - `process_bind_param()` with proper Union types
  - `process_result_value()` with proper return types
- Fixed unreachable code warnings by restructuring logic and adding type ignore comments

#### app/db/session.py
- Fixed CircuitState enum comparison (was comparing to string "open", now compares to `CircuitState.OPEN`)
- Added missing imports: `Dict`, `Union` types and `CircuitState` enum
- Fixed type annotation for `get_connection_pool_stats()` return type
- Added type annotation for `session` variable in `get_db()`

## Design Decisions Preserved

### GUID Type
- Intentionally returns strings for cross-database compatibility
- PostgreSQL uses native UUID type internally
- SQLite stores as strings
- Always returns string representation to ensure consistent behavior

### JSON Type
- Handles both PostgreSQL native JSON and SQLite text storage
- Validates JSON on input/output
- Properly typed to accept/return dict or list types
