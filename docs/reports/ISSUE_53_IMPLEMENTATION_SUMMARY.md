  - `GET /metrics/architectural/schedules` - List scheduled reports
  - `PUT /metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}` - Update schedules
  - `DELETE /metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}` - Delete schedules
  - `GET /metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}/history` - Get execution history

#### 5. Email Notification System
**File**: `app/utils/email.py`

- Email notification for completed reports
- HTML-formatted emails with download links
- Failure notifications with error details
- Support for multiple recipients

#### 6. Celery Task Integration
**Updated**: `app/celery/tasks.py`

- Background report generation support
- Integration with architectural report generator
- Asynchronous processing for large reports

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Comprehensive Metrics Report**
- System generates PDF/HTML reports showing:
  - Automation coverage (percentage and trends)
  - Detection time metrics (average, median, by severity)
  - Developer adoption rate (active users, growth rate)
  - Compliance scores (overall and by category)
  - Violation frequency (weekly averages, top violations)

✅ **Lagging Indicators with Trends**
- Reports include historical data for 30+ days showing:
  - Architectural debt velocity (daily rate, improving/worsening trend)
  - Security incident reduction (percentage reduction, monthly trends)
  - Maintainability improvements (improvement rate percentage)
  - Development velocity impact (success rates, completion times)

✅ **ROI Analysis**
- Detailed reports with:
  - Implementation costs (tools, training, developer time)
  - Cost avoidance (prevented incidents, avoided fixes)
  - Productivity gains (automation savings, reduced rework)
  - Quality improvements (bug prevention, debt reduction)
  - Calculated ROI percentage and payback period

✅ **Scheduled Reports**
- Automatic report generation via cron expressions:
  - Weekly reports: `0 9 * * MON`
  - Monthly reports: `0 9 1 * *`
  - Custom schedules supported
  - No manual intervention required

✅ **Email Notifications**
- Stakeholders receive notifications with:
  - Report generation confirmation
  - Direct download links
  - Report metadata (period, format)
  - Failure notifications with error details

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Data Sources
- Pulls metrics from existing database models:
  - `Scan` - For automation coverage
  - `VulnerabilityFinding` - For violation tracking
  - `Task` - For development velocity
  - `AuditLog` - For user activity
  - `Report` - For report management

#### Chart Generation
- Uses matplotlib for creating:
  - Bar charts for automation coverage
  - Line charts for trend analysis
  - Pie charts for ROI breakdown
  - All charts embedded as base64 in reports

#### Report Templates
- HTML templates using Jinja2
- Responsive design with modern styling
- Color-coded metrics (green/red/yellow)
- Progress bars and badges for visual clarity

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented in `tests/test_issue_53.py`:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Metrics calculation accuracy
  - Report generation logic
  - Schedule management

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Database query validation
  - Report file generation
  - Email notification flow

- **Acceptance Tests**:
  - All acceptance criteria validated
  - End-to-end workflow testing

### Dependencies Added

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `reportlab>=4.0.0` - PDF generation
- `matplotlib>=3.7.0` - Chart creation
- `pandas>=2.0.0` - Data manipulation
- `croniter>=2.0.0` - Cron expression parsing

### API Documentation

All endpoints include:
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Request/response schemas
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Authentication and permission requirements

### Configuration

New settings supported:
- `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` - Directory for generated reports

- Batch database queries for efficiency
- Asynchronous report generation
- Background task processing with Celery
- Optimized chart generation

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Interactive dashboard UI
2. Real-time metrics streaming
3. Custom metric definitions
4. Report template customization
5. Integration with BI tools
6. Mobile app notifications
7. Comparative analysis between periods
8. Predictive analytics using ML

### Deployment Notes

1. Run database migrations if needed
2. Configure SMTP settings for email
3. Set up Celery workers for background tasks
4. Create report output directory
5. Configure cron job for scheduled execution

### Validation

The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Generates comprehensive metrics reports
- ✅ Calculates accurate ROI analysis
- ✅ Supports scheduled generation
- ✅ Sends email notifications
- ✅ Provides REST API access
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Includes comprehensive testing
