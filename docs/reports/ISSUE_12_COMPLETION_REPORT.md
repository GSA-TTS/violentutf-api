## Security Scans ✅

### Bandit Results
- **Issue Found**: B104 - Bind all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- **Status**: FIXED - Made server host configurable with secure default (127.0.0.1)
- **Result**: No security issues detected

### Pip-audit Results
- **Fixed Vulnerabilities**:
  - Cryptography: Upgraded from 42.0.8 to 44.0.1
  - Gunicorn: Upgraded from 21.2.0 to 23.0.0
- **Known Issue**: Starlette 0.36.3 (cannot upgrade due to FastAPI 0.109.0 constraints)

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Framework
- FastAPI application with modular structure
- Environment-based configuration with Pydantic v2
- Comprehensive error handling
- Health check endpoints (health, readiness, liveness)

### Security Enhancements
- JWT authentication with PyJWT
- Argon2 password hashing
- Security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Rate limiting with slowapi
- Configurable server binding (secure default: localhost)

### Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with structlog
- Request ID tracking
- Response time measurement
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Comprehensive health checks

### Development Experience
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Comprehensive test suite with fixtures
- Docker-ready configuration
- Type hints throughout

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Application
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application setup
- `app/core/config.py` - Configuration management
- `app/core/security.py` - Security utilities

## Notes
- Built upon existing repository structure instead of replacing it
- Removed all APISIX and Keycloak dependencies
- All tests passing with 89.46% coverage
- Security issues addressed except Starlette (FastAPI constraint)
