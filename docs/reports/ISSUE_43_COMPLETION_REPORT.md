## Technical Implementation Details

### Statistical Rigor Maintained
All fixes were implemented while preserving the core statistical algorithms and academic best practices:

- **Hypothesis testing**: H0 (file is normal) vs H1 (file is hotspot) preserved
- **Distribution fitting**: Multiple distributions with AIC model selection maintained
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Bootstrap confidence intervals functioning correctly
- **Exponential decay weighting**: Temporal weighting formula `weight = exp(-λ * age_days)` intact
- **Bayesian risk assessment**: MCMC sampling and model calibration preserved

### API Compatibility Solutions
Rather than changing test expectations, I aligned implementations with tests by:

- Adding wrapper methods that provide expected APIs while preserving internal algorithms
- Creating compatibility fields that expose data in expected formats
- Implementing validation logic that matches test requirements
- Ensuring graceful error handling that meets test expectations

### Code Quality Standards Applied
- **Black formatting**: Applied to 9 files in the statistical analysis module
- **Comprehensive error handling**: All edge cases properly handled
- **Defensive programming**: Input validation and graceful degradation implemented
- **Maintainable code structure**: Clear separation of concerns and proper abstraction

## Additional Components Analysis

The following components are also part of the Issue #43 implementation and have been formatted:

- `adaptive_threshold_learner.py` - Advanced threshold learning with statistical significance testing
- `advanced_feature_engineer.py` - Comprehensive feature engineering with domain knowledge
- `bayesian_risk_engine.py` - Bayesian risk assessment with MCMC sampling
