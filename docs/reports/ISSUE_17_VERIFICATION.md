- [x] Add performance benchmarks
- [x] Verify security measures
- [x] Test coverage >80% on data layer (80.86% achieved)
- [x] All critical repository operations tested

### Documentation
- [x] Document session management
- [x] Create repository usage guide
- [x] Write resilience pattern docs
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide
