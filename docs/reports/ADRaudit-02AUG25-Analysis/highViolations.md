Unlike critical violations that pose immediate security risks, these high-risk issues primarily affect **operational effectiveness, user experience, and long-term sustainability**.

**The remediation approach is structured to deliver maximum government value:**
- **Phase 1** establishes the foundational data and integration capabilities required for government operations
- **Phase 2** enhances operational excellence through configuration management and user experience improvements
- **Phase 3** ensures long-term success through comprehensive testing, documentation, and monitoring

**Upon completion of this 12-week remediation program, the ViolentUTF API will achieve:**
- **>85% ADR compliance** across all architectural decisions
- **Full FEA alignment** with federal enterprise architecture standards
- **Complete NIST integration** for cybersecurity framework compliance
- **Government-ready operations** with appropriate user experience and monitoring

**This systematic approach transforms the platform from a high-risk government deployment into a robust, compliant, and sustainable AI red-teaming solution that can serve federal cybersecurity needs for years to come.**
