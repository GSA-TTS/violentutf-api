## User Story Validation

> **Original User Story**: "As an audit team member, I need to identify code areas with frequent architectural violations"

**âœ… SATISFIED**: The implemented solution provides audit team members with comprehensive tooling to identify, analyze, and prioritize code areas with frequent architectural violations through automated Git history analysis and risk scoring.

---

## Acceptance Criteria Compliance

### âœ… 1. Implement Git History Analysis Tool
**Requirement**: Implement git history analysis tool
**Implementation**: `tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py`

**Features Delivered**:
- Complete Git repository traversal using PyDriller
- Commit message parsing for architectural fix detection
- Conventional Commits format support with fallback patterns
- Configurable analysis window (default: 180 days, tested with 30 days)
- Robust error handling and security validation

**Code Evidence**:
```bash
python3 tools/pre_audit/historical_analyzer.py . --days 30 --verbose
# âœ… Successfully processed 54 commits in 0.53 seconds
# âœ… Found 11 violation commits affecting 100 files
```

### âœ… 2. Identify Violation Hotspots from Last 6 Months
**Requirement**: Identify violation hotspots from last 6 months
**Implementation**: Multi-factor risk scoring algorithm

**Features Delivered**:
- Configurable analysis window (supports 6+ months: `--days 180`)
- Advanced hotspot identification using 4-factor risk scoring:
  - **Frequency**: Raw violation count per file
  - **Recency**: Time-decay weighting (1.0 = today, 0.1 = window edge)
  - **Severity**: ADR-specific impact multipliers (0.7 to 1.6)
  - **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity from static analysis

**Risk Scoring Formula**:
```
Risk Score = (Frequency Ã— RecencyWeight) Ã— SeverityWeight Ã— ComplexityScore
```
With logarithmic normalization for scores > 100 to prevent range explosion.

**Validation Results**:
- Top 3 hotspots identified: auth.py (37.74), input_validation.py (17.69), metrics.py (15.92)
- 100 files analyzed with violations across 11 commits
- Proper temporal weighting applied to prioritize recent violations

### âœ… 3. Categorize Violation Patterns by ADR Type
**Requirement**: Categorize violation patterns by ADR type
**Implementation**: `config/violation_patterns.yml` with comprehensive ADR mapping

**Features Delivered**:
- **20 ADR categories** mapped to specific violation patterns
- **Enhanced pattern matching** with keywords, file patterns, and diff patterns
- **Advanced ADR-specific analysis**:
  - ADR-002 (Authentication): JWT algorithms, RS256, token validation
  - ADR-005 (Rate Limiting): Token bucket, Redis state, HTTP headers
  - ADR-008 (Logging): Structured JSON, correlation IDs, PII redaction
- **Security-focused patterns**: Input validation, configuration security

**Pattern Categories Implemented**:
1. Core ADRs (ADR-001 through ADR-010)
2. Feature ADRs (ADR-F1.1 through ADR-F4.2)
3. Security ADRs (ADR-SEC-001, ADR-SEC-002)
4. General patterns (GENERAL-SECURITY, MIDDLEWARE-VIOLATIONS)

**Evidence**:
```yaml
# Example ADR-002 Enhanced Patterns
patterns:
  conventional_commit_scope: "auth"
  keywords:
    - "rs256 algorithm"
    - "jwt signing"
    - "token expiration"
  file_patterns:
    - "**/auth/**"
    - "**/middleware/auth*"
  diff_patterns:
    - "jwt.encode"
    - "RS256"
```

### âœ… 4. Track Remediation Effectiveness
**Requirement**: Track remediation effectiveness
**Implementation**: Temporal violation tracking with trend analysis

**Features Delivered**:
- **First/Last violation timestamps** for each file
- **Recency weighting** to prioritize recent violations over historical ones
- **Violation frequency trends** showing improvement/degradation patterns
- **Baseline establishment** for measuring future improvements

**Effectiveness Metrics**:
- Violation period tracking (e.g., "2025-07-24 to 2025-07-31")
- Recency-weighted risk scores that naturally decay for older violations
- Recommended re-analysis frequency (monthly) for trend tracking

**Report Includes**:
> "**Baseline Established**: This report serves as the baseline for measuring improvement
> **Re-run Frequency**: Recommended monthly analysis to track trends
> **Success Metrics**: Target 20% reduction in high-risk files within 3 months"

### âœ… 5. Generate High-Risk Files List
**Requirement**: Generate high-risk files list
**Implementation**: Comprehensive Markdown reporting with enhanced naming

**Features Delivered**:
- **Top 20 high-risk files** ranked by multi-factor risk score
- **Detailed file analysis** for files with Risk Score > 5.0
- **ADR violation breakdown** per file with severity weights
- **Actionable recommendations** for immediate and medium-term actions
- **Enhanced report naming**: `ADRaudit_{TopADR}Violations_{Commits}commits_{Files}files_{Date}.md`

**High-Risk Files Example**:
```markdown
| Rank | File Path | Risk Score | Violations | Complexity | Primary ADRs Violated |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `app/api/endpoints/auth.py` | 37.74 | 4 | 8.0 | ADR-002 (2), MIDDLEWARE-VIOLATIONS (1) |
| 2 | `app/core/input_validation.py` | 17.69 | 2 | 6.91 | ADR-005 (1), ADR-002 (1) |
```
