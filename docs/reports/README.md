# Reports Directory

This directory contains implementation reports, verification documents, and project status tracking for the ViolentUTF API development.

## Report Structure

Reports follow a consistent naming convention and format for easy navigation and historical tracking.

### Naming Convention
- **Completion Reports**: `ISSUE_<number>_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- **Verification Reports**: `ISSUE_<number>_VERIFICATION.md`
- **Status Reports**: `issue_<number>_status.md`
- **Summary Reports**: `<topic>_SUMMARY.md`

### Report Types

#### Implementation Reports

## Generating Reports

### Test Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Generate XML for CI integration
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml
```

### Security Scan Reports
```bash
# Bandit security scan
bandit -r app/ -f json -o reports/bandit-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Dependency audit
pip-audit --desc --format json > reports/pip-audit-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Semgrep scan
semgrep --config=auto --json -o reports/semgrep-$(date +%Y%m%d).json app/
```

### Performance Reports
```bash
# Run load tests
locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py --html reports/performance-$(date +%Y%m%d).html

# Generate API performance metrics
python scripts/benchmark_api.py > reports/api-benchmark-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Code Quality Reports
```bash
# Type checking report
mypy app/ --html-report reports/mypy-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Linting report
flake8 app/ --format=html --htmldir=reports/flake8-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Complexity analysis
radon cc app/ -j > reports/complexity-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
