### Completed Items (Per Issue #13 Requirements)

#### 1. Security Headers Middleware ✅
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) with configurable max-age
- CSP (Content Security Policy) with production/development modes
- X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy disabling sensitive features

#### 2. CORS Configuration ✅
- Configured in app/main.py with restrictive default policy
- Environment-specific allowed origins
- Configurable methods and headers
- Proper preflight handling

#### 3. Request/Response Logging Middleware ✅
- Comprehensive logging in app/middleware/logging.py
- Request start and completion logging
- Duration tracking in milliseconds
- Health endpoint exclusion to reduce noise
- Error logging with stack traces

#### 4. Metrics Collection Middleware ✅
- Prometheus metrics in app/middleware/metrics.py
- REQUEST_COUNT counter with method/endpoint/status labels
- REQUEST_DURATION histogram for timing
- ACTIVE_REQUESTS gauge for concurrent requests
- Endpoint normalization for path parameters

#### 5. Structured Logging with Correlation IDs ✅
- Request ID middleware generates/preserves correlation IDs
- UUID format for generated IDs
- Request context includes request_id, method, path, client_ip
- Correlation ID flows through all log entries

#### 6. Performance Timing Metrics ✅
- Request duration calculation in request_id middleware
- X-Response-Time header added to responses
- Timing for both successful and failed requests
- Prometheus histograms for detailed timing analysis

#### 7. Error Handling Framework ✅
- Comprehensive error classes in app/core/errors.py
- Consistent error response format
- Request ID included in error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Stack trace logging for debugging

#### 8. Monitoring Endpoints ✅
- `/health` - Basic health check endpoint
- `/ready` - Readiness probe with dependency checks
- `/live` - Liveness probe for kubernetes
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

### Testing Requirements Completed

#### 1. Security Headers Present in Responses ✅
- 15+ tests in `tests/unit/middleware/test_security_middleware.py`
- Validates all security headers are correctly set
- Tests for both development and production modes

#### 2. CORS Policy Works Correctly ✅
- CORS configuration verified in main.py tests
- Interaction with security headers tested
- Preflight request handling validated

#### 3. Metrics Are Collected ✅
- 20+ tests in `tests/unit/middleware/test_metrics_middleware.py`
- Verifies Prometheus metrics collection
- Tests counter, histogram, and gauge metrics

#### 4. Logging Includes Correlation IDs ✅
- Tests in `tests/unit/middleware/test_request_id_middleware.py`
- Validates UUID generation and preservation
- Ensures correlation ID flows through logs

#### 5. Error Handling Works Properly ✅
- Tests in `tests/unit/test_errors.py`
- Validates error response format
- Ensures request ID included in errors

### Enhanced Middleware Features

1. **Security Headers (app/middleware/security.py)**
   - Explicit header configuration instead of library defaults
   - Environment-aware CSP policies
   - Comprehensive security header set

2. **Request Timing (app/middleware/request_id.py)**
   - Implemented request duration calculation
   - Added timing to both successful and failed requests
   - Integrated with structured logging

### Files Created/Modified
- `tests/unit/middleware/test_security_middleware.py` - NEW (265 lines)
- `tests/unit/middleware/test_request_id_middleware.py` - NEW
- `tests/unit/middleware/test_logging_middleware.py` - NEW
- `tests/unit/middleware/test_metrics_middleware.py` - NEW (344 lines)
- `app/middleware/security.py` - ENHANCED
- `app/middleware/request_id.py` - ENHANCED

### Key Achievements

1. **Complete Implementation**: All 8 tasks from Issue #13 are fully implemented
2. **Testing Coverage**: All 5 testing requirements have comprehensive test suites
3. **Code Quality**: Security headers, logging, metrics, and monitoring are production-ready
4. **Performance**: Request timing and metrics collection with minimal overhead

### Technical Highlights

- **Security**: Comprehensive security headers protecting against common vulnerabilities
- **Observability**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health check endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with request tracking

### Conclusion
Issue #13 has been fully completed. All specified tasks for implementing security middleware and monitoring are done:
- ✅ Security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- ✅ CORS configuration with restrictive defaults
- ✅ Request/response logging middleware
- ✅ Metrics collection middleware
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs
- ✅ Performance timing metrics
- ✅ Error handling framework
- ✅ Monitoring endpoints

All testing requirements are also satisfied with comprehensive test suites verifying each component's functionality.
