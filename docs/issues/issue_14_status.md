# Issue #14 Implementation Status

## Implemented Features ✅

### Health Endpoints
- [x] **Liveness endpoint** (`/live`) - Simple check that returns 200 if service is running
- [x] **Readiness endpoint** (`/ready`) - Comprehensive check with dependency verification
- [x] **Health endpoint** (`/health`) - Basic health status with service metadata

### Dependency Checks
- [x] **Database connectivity check** - Via `check_database_health()` from db.session
- [x] **Redis connectivity check** - Via `check_cache_health()` from utils.cache
- [x] **Disk space check** - `check_disk_space()` with configurable threshold (default 90%)
- [x] **Memory usage check** - `check_memory()` with configurable threshold (default 90%)

### Optimizations
- [x] **Parallel health checks** - Using `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent execution
- [x] **Health check metrics** - Using `@track_health_check` decorator for monitoring

## Not Yet Implemented ❌
- [ ] **Health check caching** - To avoid excessive dependency checks

## Testing Status

### Implemented Tests ✅
- [x] Health endpoints return correct status codes
- [x] Dependency failures are properly detected
- [x] Parallel checks work correctly
- [x] All three endpoints are accessible

### Missing Tests ❌
- [ ] Performance test (< 200ms requirement)
- [ ] Caching functionality tests (feature not implemented)

## Code Locations

### Main Implementation
- `/app/api/endpoints/health.py` - All health endpoints

### Supporting Functions
- `/app/db/session.py` - `check_database_health()`
- `/app/utils/cache.py` - `check_cache_health()`
- `/app/utils/monitoring.py` - `check_dependency_health()`, `@track_health_check`

### Tests
- `/tests/unit/test_enhanced_health.py` - Comprehensive health endpoint tests
- `/tests/unit/db/test_session.py` - Database health check tests
- `/tests/unit/utils/test_cache.py` - Cache health check tests

## Recommendations

1. **Add health check caching**: Implement a simple cache mechanism to avoid hitting dependencies too frequently (e.g., cache results for 10-30 seconds)

2. **Add performance test**: Create a test that verifies the readiness check completes within 200ms

3. **Consider rate limiting**: Add rate limiting to health endpoints to prevent abuse

4. **Add more detailed metrics**: Consider adding more granular metrics like response times for each dependency

## Summary

Issue #14 is approximately **90% complete**. All core functionality is implemented and tested. Only the caching feature and performance testing remain to be added.
