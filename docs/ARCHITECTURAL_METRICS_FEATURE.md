### Database Configuration
Reports and schedules are stored in the existing PostgreSQL database with proper indexes for performance.

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Reports require authentication
   - Schedule creation requires `reports.schedule` permission
   - Report execution requires `reports.execute` permission

2. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive metrics are aggregated
   - PII is excluded from reports
   - Download links expire after configured time

3. **Email Security**
   - TLS encryption for SMTP
   - Authenticated sending only
   - Rate limiting on notifications

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**
   - Metrics cached for 1 hour
   - Query results reused within reports

2. **Async Processing**
   - Report generation in background
   - Non-blocking API responses

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexed queries
   - Aggregated calculations
   - Batch processing

## Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

- Success/failure rates
- Email delivery status
- Schedule execution accuracy

### Logging
- Detailed logging at each step
- Error tracking with context
- Performance metrics logged

## Future Enhancements
