# Implementation Blueprint: Issue 87 - Repository Registration & Startup Configuration

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Complete repository registration in dependency container and configure FastAPI startup with repository initialization

**Outcome**: All 8 repository implementations properly registered in DI container with health monitoring and lifecycle management

**Key Achievements**:
- Centralized repository management
- Integrated health checks
- Proper session lifecycle
- Enhanced testability

## Problem Statement & Analysis

### Original Problem
The current system has incomplete repository registration in the dependency injection container, leading to:
- Manual repository instantiation in services
- No centralized health monitoring
- Complex dependency management
- Inconsistent lifecycle handling

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incomplete Container Integration**: Only some repository interfaces have convenience functions
2. **Missing Lifecycle Management**: No startup/shutdown hooks for repositories
3. **Health Check Gaps**: System health doesn't validate repository connectivity
4. **Session Management Issues**: Database sessions not properly scoped for repositories

### Initial Assessment
- 8 repository interfaces need registration: User, ApiKey, Session, Audit, SecurityScan, Vulnerability, Role, Health
- Current container.py has partial implementation
- FastAPI deps.py creates repositories manually
- Health endpoints lack repository status

## Technical Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Container Registration Enhancement
**Description**: Complete repository registration in DI container
**Files Affected**: `app/core/container.py`
**Implementation**:
- Register all 8 repository implementations using factory pattern
- Add error handling for repository initialization failures
- Implement singleton pattern for repository instances where appropriate
- Add container health validation methods

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given the dependency injection container is initialized
When I request any of the 8 repository interfaces
Then the container returns a properly configured repository instance
And the instance has valid database connectivity
```

### Task 2: Repository Factory Pattern Implementation
**Description**: Create factory functions with proper error handling
**Files Affected**: `app/core/container.py`, `app/repositories/__init__.py`
**Implementation**:
- Create factory functions for each repository type
- Add connection validation and retry logic
- Implement proper error propagation
- Add logging for factory operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given a repository factory is invoked
When database connection is available
Then a valid repository instance is returned
And connection is validated before return

Given a repository factory is invoked
When database connection fails
Then an appropriate error is raised with context
And failure is logged for monitoring
```

### Task 3: FastAPI Startup Integration
**Description**: Initialize repositories during application startup
**Files Affected**: `app/main.py`, `app/core/startup.py`
**Implementation**:
- Add repository initialization to startup lifecycle
- Configure database connection pooling for repositories
- Add graceful degradation for repository failures
- Implement cleanup during shutdown

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given FastAPI application starts up
When repository initialization is triggered
Then all repositories are registered in container
And startup succeeds with proper logging

Given FastAPI application shuts down
When repository cleanup is triggered
Then all repository connections are closed
And no resource leaks occur
```

### Task 4: FastAPI Dependency Functions
**Description**: Create dependency functions for repository injection
**Files Affected**: `app/api/deps.py`
**Implementation**:
- Replace manual repository creation with container resolution
- Add proper error handling for dependency resolution
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given an API endpoint requires a repository
When the dependency function is invoked
Then repository is resolved from container
And proper error handling occurs for failures

Given multiple endpoints use the same repository
When dependency functions are invoked concurrently
Then repository instances are properly shared/scoped
And no race conditions occur
```

### Task 5: Health Check Integration
**Description**: Add repository health checks to system health endpoints
**Files Affected**: `app/api/endpoints/health.py`, `app/repositories/health.py`
**Implementation**:
- Add repository connectivity checks
- Include repository metrics in health responses
- Implement health check timeouts and retries
- Add repository status monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given health endpoint is called
When all repositories are healthy
Then health response includes repository status "healthy"
And response time is within acceptable limits

Given health endpoint is called
When any repository is unhealthy
Then health response indicates degraded status
And specific repository issues are identified
```

### Task 6: Database Session Management
**Description**: Implement proper session lifecycle for repositories
**Files Affected**: `app/core/container.py`, `app/db/session.py`
**Implementation**:
- Configure session scoping for repository instances
- Add session cleanup and error handling
- Implement connection pool monitoring
- Add session leak detection

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given repository operations are performed
When database sessions are used
Then sessions are properly scoped and cleaned up
And no session leaks occur

Given concurrent repository operations
When multiple sessions are active
Then connection pool limits are respected
And performance remains acceptable
```

## Security Considerations (STRIDE Analysis)

### Spoofing
- **Threat**: Malicious code could register fake repositories
- **Mitigation**: Container registration occurs only during controlled startup

### Tampering
- **Threat**: Repository instances could be modified after registration
- **Mitigation**: Use immutable container patterns, validate instances

### Repudiation
- **Threat**: Repository operations could lack audit trail
- **Mitigation**: All repository creation/access logged

### Information Disclosure
- **Threat**: Repository health checks could leak database information
- **Mitigation**: Sanitize health check responses, use abstract status indicators

### Denial of Service
- **Threat**: Repository initialization failures could prevent startup
- **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, timeout handling, resource limits

### Elevation of Privilege
- **Threat**: Container could provide unauthorized repository access
- **Mitigation**: Repository-level authorization, proper session scoping

### Rolling Deployment
- Backward compatibility maintained during deployment
- Graceful startup/shutdown sequences
- Health check integration with load balancers

### Rollback Strategy
- Container registration can be reverted
