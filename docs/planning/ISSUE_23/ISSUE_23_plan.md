## 3. Conflict and Gap Analysis

### Identified Alignment Points

All user stories and their acceptance criteria have been carefully designed to align with the governing ADRs. The following alignment points are particularly strong:

1. **ADR-012 Hybrid Strategy**: US-106 explicitly implements the hybrid approach, supporting both local and Docker-based testing as specified in the ADR.

2. **ADR-007 Async Processing**: US-105 includes specific acceptance criteria for testing async task processing with polling and webhooks.

3. **ADR-008 Structured Logging**: US-107 mandates JSON logging with correlation IDs throughout the test infrastructure.

4. **ADR-010 Dependency Management**: US-104 integrates container scanning into the CI/CD pipeline with defined severity thresholds.

5. **ADR-011 Historical Analysis**: US-107 leverages the historical analysis tool for test pattern detection.

### Potential Gaps Requiring Attention

#### Gap 1: Performance Testing Accuracy in Containers
- **Issue**: ADR-012 acknowledges that container-based performance testing may not accurately reflect production performance due to virtualization overhead.
- **Affected User Story**: US-105
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement baseline calibration to account for container overhead
  - Consider supplementary bare-metal performance testing for critical paths
  - Document expected variance between container and production metrics
  - **Recommendation**: Create a follow-up ADR for "Production Performance Testing Strategy" within 3 months

#### Gap 2: Secret Management in Test Environments
- **Issue**: While ADR-012 mentions Docker Compose secrets, there's no comprehensive strategy for test credential management across local and Docker environments.
- **Affected User Stories**: US-101, US-103, US-104
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement HashiCorp Vault or similar for test secrets
  - Use environment-specific secret injection
  - Never commit test credentials to version control
  - **Recommendation**: Leverage ADR-F4-2 (Secret Management) patterns for test environments

#### Gap 3: Test Data Privacy Compliance
- **Issue**: Test data management doesn't explicitly address GDPR/privacy requirements for test data that might resemble real user data.
- **Affected User Story**: US-103
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement data anonymization for production-like test data
  - Add explicit "test data" markers to all generated data
  - Regular audits of test data to ensure no production data leakage
  - **Recommendation**: Extend test data management practices to include privacy compliance checks
