# Fix Documentation: pytest_missing_aiohttp.json

## Fix Applied
**Type**: DEPENDENCY_ERROR Resolution
**Date**: 2025-08-25
**Original NFO**: pytest_missing_aiohttp.json

## Problem Summary
Circuit breaker integration test was failing with ModuleNotFoundError because it imports `aiohttp` which was not listed in any requirements file, despite being needed for HTTP client testing scenarios.

## Root Cause Analysis
The test `tests/security/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py` at line 776 imports aiohttp for HTTP client integration testing, but this dependency was not declared in either `requirements.txt` or `requirements-dev.txt`.

## Solution Applied
**Selected Hypothesis**: PRIMARY - Add aiohttp to requirements-dev.txt as optional test dependency

### Changes Made
1. **File**: `/Users/tamnguyen/Documents/GitHub/violentutf-api/requirements-dev.txt`
   - **Line Added**: `aiohttp>=3.9.0,<4.0.0`
   - **Section**: Added under "HTTP Client Testing (Optional)"

### Validation in Sandbox
- ✅ aiohttp dependency added to development requirements
- ✅ Version constraint follows project patterns (>=X.Y.0,<X+1.0.0)
- ✅ Marked as optional testing dependency to indicate usage scope

## Expected Outcome
- Circuit breaker HTTP client integration test should now run successfully
- `import aiohttp` statement will no longer cause ModuleNotFoundError
- HTTP client circuit breaker functionality can be properly tested

## Affected Test
- `tests/security/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py::TestCircuitBreakerIntegration::test_http_client_integration`

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Impact**: Positive - enables previously failing test without affecting production
- **Scope**: Development environment only (requirements-dev.txt)
- **Rollback**: Simple - remove aiohttp from requirements-dev.txt

## Alternative Considered
Using pytest.importorskip was considered but rejected because:
1. The test specifically validates HTTP client circuit breaker behavior
2. Conditional test execution reduces coverage value
3. aiohttp is a well-maintained, stable dependency suitable for testing

## Testing Recommendation
Install updated dev requirements and run the specific test:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/security/test_circuit_breaker_enhanced.py::TestCircuitBreakerIntegration::test_http_client_integration -v
```
