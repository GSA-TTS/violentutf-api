# Fix Report: greenlet_missing.json

## Issue Summary
- **NFO**: greenlet_missing.json
- **Original Problem**: greenlet library required for SQLAlchemy async operations but not installed
- **Failure Type**: DEPENDENCY_ERROR (ModuleNotFoundError)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL

## Root Cause Analysis
The NFO indicated that greenlet was missing from the environment, causing SQLAlchemy async operations to fail with "ValueError: the greenlet library is required to use this function." However, investigation showed the dependency was properly installed.

## Solution Applied
**No code changes required** - the dependency was already correctly installed and functional.

## Validation Results
✅ **greenlet availability confirmed**: `python3 -c "import greenlet; print('greenlet version:', greenlet.__version__)"`
- Result: greenlet version: 3.2.4

✅ **SQLAlchemy async operations working**: Full test suite with async database operations passed

✅ **API key service tests functional**: All previously failing tests now pass

## Context Gathered
- `requirements.txt` includes `greenlet>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`
- `pyproject.toml` includes matching dependency specification
- Virtual environment has greenlet 3.2.4 properly installed
- SQLAlchemy async engine operations work correctly
- All async database-dependent tests pass

## Fix Classification
- **Type**: False positive - dependency was already resolved
- **Action**: Validation and status update only
- **Risk**: None - no changes to production code
- **Architectural Impact**: None

## Full Validation in Sandbox
- Greenlet import functionality: ✅ PASS
- SQLAlchemy async operations: ✅ PASS
- Database service tests: ✅ PASS
- Full pre-commit suite: ✅ PASS (185 tests passed)

## Technical Details
Greenlet provides the coroutine-to-greenlet bridge required by SQLAlchemy for async database operations. The installed version (3.2.4) meets the requirement specification and all async functionality is operating correctly.

This NFO appears to have been from a previous environment state where the dependency was not properly installed. The current environment has all required async database dependencies properly configured.
