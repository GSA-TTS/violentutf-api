# Fix Report: aiosqlite_import.json

## Issue Summary
- **NFO**: aiosqlite_import.json
- **Original Problem**: aiosqlite module not installed but required for SQLite async database operations in tests
- **Failure Type**: DEPENDENCY_ERROR (ModuleNotFoundError)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL

## Root Cause Analysis
The NFO indicated that aiosqlite was missing from the environment, causing SQLAlchemy async engine creation to fail. However, upon investigation, the dependency was actually properly installed and available.

## Solution Applied
**No code changes required** - the dependency was already correctly installed and functional.

## Validation Results
✅ **aiosqlite availability confirmed**: `python3 -c "import aiosqlite; print('aiosqlite version:', aiosqlite.__version__)"`
- Result: aiosqlite version: 0.21.0

✅ **SQLite async tests passing**: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_config.py -v`
- Result: 9/9 tests passed

✅ **Database connectivity verified**: All database configuration tests pass with SQLite async backend

## Context Gathered
- `requirements.txt` includes `aiosqlite>=0.19.0,<0.22.0`
- `pyproject.toml` includes matching dependency specification
- Virtual environment has aiosqlite 0.21.0 properly installed
- SQLAlchemy async engine creation works correctly

## Fix Classification
- **Type**: False positive - dependency was already resolved
- **Action**: Validation and status update only
- **Risk**: None - no changes to production code
- **Architectural Impact**: None

## Full Validation in Sandbox
- Tested import functionality: ✅ PASS
- Tested SQLAlchemy integration: ✅ PASS
- Tested configuration module: ✅ PASS
- Full pre-commit suite: ✅ PASS (185 tests passed)

## Recommendation
This NFO appears to have been from a previous environment state. All aiosqlite functionality is working correctly in the current environment.
