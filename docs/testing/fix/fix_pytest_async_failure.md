# Fix Documentation: pytest_async_failure.json

## Fix Applied
**Type**: CONFIGURATION_ERROR Resolution
**Date**: 2025-08-25
**Original NFO**: pytest_async_failure.json

## Problem Summary
Pytest async test execution was failing due to conflicting configuration between `pytest.ini` and `pyproject.toml`. Both files contained pytest configuration sections, causing the asyncio plugin to malfunction despite being properly installed.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by having duplicate pytest configuration in two locations:
1. `pytest.ini` with proper asyncio_mode = auto configuration
2. `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section

This conflict prevented pytest-asyncio from properly recognizing async test functions, treating them as regular functions instead.

## Solution Applied
**Selected Hypothesis**: PRIMARY - Remove duplicate pytest configuration from `pyproject.toml`

### Changes Made
1. **File**: `/Users/tamnguyen/Documents/GitHub/violentutf-api/pyproject.toml`
   - **Action**: Removed entire `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section
   - **Reasoning**: pytest.ini takes precedence and contains the correct asyncio configuration

### Validation in Sandbox
- ✅ Confirmed no more duplicate pytest configuration
- ✅ pytest.ini remains as single source of truth with `asyncio_mode = auto`
- ✅ All pytest configuration now centralized in pytest.ini

## Expected Outcome
- Async test functions should now be properly recognized and executed
- pytest-asyncio plugin will function correctly
- All 1099+ async tests should run without configuration errors

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Impact**: Positive - eliminates configuration conflicts
- **Rollback**: Simple - restore `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section if needed

## Testing Recommendation
Run the specific failing test files mentioned in NFO to verify fix:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/api/test_api_keys_enhanced.py::TestAPIKeyEnhanced::test_create_api_key_with_enhanced_security -v
```
