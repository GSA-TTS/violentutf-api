# Fix Report: pytest_4.json

## Issue Summary
- **NFO**: pytest_4.json
- **Original Problem**: pytest-timeout plugin not installed but used in pre-commit runner with --timeout argument
- **Failure Type**: CONFIGURATION_ERROR (PluginNotFound)
- **Severity**: HIGH

## Root Cause Analysis
The NFO indicated that pytest-timeout plugin was missing, causing the pre-commit pytest runner to fail with "unrecognized arguments: --timeout=30". However, investigation showed the plugin was properly installed.

## Solution Applied
**No code changes required** - the dependency was already correctly installed and functional.

## Validation Results
✅ **pytest-timeout plugin available**: `python3 -c "import pytest_timeout; print('pytest-timeout is installed')"`
- Result: pytest-timeout is installed

✅ **Timeout argument recognized**: `python3 -m pytest --timeout=30 --help | grep timeout`
- Result: Multiple timeout-related options displayed

✅ **Pre-commit pytest runner functional**: `python3 .pre-commit-pytest-runner.py`
- Result: 185 tests passed with 30-second timeout configured

## Context Gathered
- `pyproject.toml` includes `pytest-timeout = ">=2.2.0,<3.0.0"` in dev dependencies
- pytest-timeout plugin is properly installed and functional
- `.pre-commit-pytest-runner.py` uses `--timeout=30` argument correctly
- Full test suite runs successfully with timeout protection

## Fix Classification
- **Type**: False positive - dependency was already resolved
- **Action**: Validation and status update only
- **Risk**: None - no changes to configuration
- **Architectural Impact**: None

## Full Validation in Sandbox
- pytest-timeout plugin import: ✅ PASS
- Timeout argument recognition: ✅ PASS
- Pre-commit test execution: ✅ PASS (185/185 tests)
- Timeout functionality: ✅ PASS (30s timeout configured)

## Technical Details
The pytest-timeout plugin provides timeout protection for individual tests and the entire test session. The pre-commit runner configuration uses:
- `--timeout=30`: 30-second timeout per test
- `timeout method: signal`: Uses signal-based timeout mechanism
- Compatible with pytest 8.x and asyncio test mode

This NFO appears to have been from a previous environment state. All timeout functionality is working correctly in the current environment.
