# Data Access Layer Test Plan

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Components to Test:
1. **BaseRepository** (`app/repositories/base.py`)
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Pagination (Page model, list_with_pagination, list_paginated)
   - Soft delete/restore operations
   - Multi-tenant organization filtering
   - Advanced filtering and search
   - Circuit breaker integration
   - Connection pool management
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Database Session Management** (`app/db/session.py`)
   - Connection creation and pooling
   - Circuit breaker for database operations
   - Health check mechanisms
   - Connection recovery and retry logic
   - Transaction management
   - Pool statistics monitoring
   - Graceful shutdown

3. **Repository Implementations**
   - UserRepository (authentication, user management)
   - Other domain-specific repositories
   - Repository inheritance patterns

## Test Scenarios

### BaseRepository Tests

#### CRUD Operations
- Create with auto-generated UUID
- Create with provided ID
- Create with audit fields (created_by, updated_by)
- Get by ID (found/not found)
- Get with organization filtering
- Update existing entity
- Update with version optimistic locking
- Update non-existent entity
- Delete (soft delete)
- Delete (hard delete)
- Delete with organization filtering
- Restore soft-deleted entity

#### Pagination Tests
- Basic pagination (page, size)
- Pagination with filters
- Pagination with sorting
- Pagination edge cases (empty results, last page)
- Page model iteration and indexing

#### Filtering Tests
- Simple field filters
- List/IN filters
- Date range filters
- Search across text fields
- Advanced operator filters (gt, lt, contains, etc.)
- Filter logic (AND/OR)
- Organization isolation

#### Error Handling
- Database connection failures
- Invalid queries
- Constraint violations
- Transaction rollbacks
- Circuit breaker activation

### Database Session Tests

#### Connection Management
- Engine creation with different database URLs
- Session creation and cleanup
- Connection pool configuration
- SQLite vs PostgreSQL handling

#### Health Checks
- Successful health check
- Health check timeout
- Health check with circuit breaker open
- Database recovery attempts

#### Circuit Breaker
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Failure threshold behavior
- Recovery timeout
- Manual reset

#### Transaction Management
- Commit on success
- Rollback on error
- Nested transactions
- Concurrent session handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end repository operations
- Multi-repository transactions
- Cascade operations
- Foreign key constraints
- Performance under load

## Coverage Goals
- Line coverage: 100%
- Branch coverage: 100%
- Edge case coverage: Comprehensive
- Error path coverage: Complete
