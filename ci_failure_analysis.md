# CI/CD Failure Analysis and Resolution

## Objective
Analyze and resolve ALL CI/CD failures reported in GitHub Actions runs.

## CI/CD Failures to Analyze:
1. https://github.com/GSA-TTS/violentutf-api/actions/runs/17097626204/job/48485685538?pr=82

## Analysis Strategy
1. Fetch failure details from each job
2. Categorize failures by type
3. Fix issues systematically
4. Ensure no regressions
5. Validate fixes locally first

## Analysis Results Summary

### CI/CD Failure Categories:

#### 1. Architectural Compliance Failures (Multiple Jobs)
- **custom-rules**: Exit code 4, architectural compliance validation failed
- **data-access-patterns**: Exit code 4, data access pattern compliance failed
- **dependency-compliance**: Exit code 4, dependency compliance validation failed
- **layer-boundaries**: Exit code 4, layer boundaries validation failed
- **security-patterns**: Exit code 4, security patterns validation failed

#### 2. Code Quality Failures
- **Black Formatter**: Exit code 1, code formatting issues detected
- **Missing Security Reports**: safety-report.json and bandit-report.json not found

#### 3. Test Execution Failures
- **Unit Tests**: Exit code 4 on ubuntu-latest/Py3.12, test execution failed
- **Architectural Audit**: Exit code 1, Claude Code architectural audit failed

## Root Cause Analysis Strategy:
1. Check local architectural compliance issues
2. Run Black formatter and fix formatting
3. Generate missing security reports
4. Fix failing unit tests
5. Address architectural audit issues
