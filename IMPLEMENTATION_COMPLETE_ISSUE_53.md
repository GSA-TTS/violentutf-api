#### ✅ ScheduledReportService (`app/services/scheduled_report_service.py`)
- **Schedule Management**: Create, update, delete schedules
- **Cron Execution**: Automatic report generation based on cron expressions
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic notifications with download links
- **History Tracking**: Complete execution history

### 2. API Endpoints Created

#### ✅ Architectural Metrics Router (`app/api/endpoints/architectural_metrics.py`)
- `GET /api/v1/metrics/architectural/leading-indicators`
- `GET /api/v1/metrics/architectural/lagging-indicators`
- `GET /api/v1/metrics/architectural/roi-analysis`
- `POST /api/v1/metrics/architectural/generate-report`
- `POST /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedule`
- `GET /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules`
- `PUT /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/metrics/architectural/schedules/{id}`

### 3. Background Processing

#### ✅ Celery Tasks Updated (`app/celery/tasks.py`)
- Enhanced `generate_report_task` to support architectural reports
- Added `execute_scheduled_reports_task` for automatic execution
- Integrated with report generator service

### 4. Email Notifications

#### ✅ Email Utility Enhanced (`app/utils/email.py`)
- `send_report_notification`: Success notifications with download links
- `send_failure_notification`: Failure alerts
- HTML email templates with professional styling

### 5. Testing

#### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite
- `tests/test_architectural_metrics.py`: Full test coverage
- `tests/test_issue_53.py`: Acceptance criteria validation
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Email notification tests

### 6. Documentation

#### ✅ Complete Documentation
- `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_METRICS_FEATURE.md`: Feature documentation
- Usage examples
- Configuration guide
- API reference

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### ✅ Criterion 1: Comprehensive Metrics Report
**Given**: The architectural audit tools are deployed and collecting data
**When**: I request an architectural metrics report via the existing reports API
**Then**: I receive a comprehensive PDF/HTML report showing:
- ✅ Automation coverage
- ✅ Detection time
- ✅ Developer adoption rate
- ✅ Compliance scores
- ✅ Violation frequency

### ✅ Criterion 2: Lagging Indicators Report
**Given**: Historical architectural data exists for at least 30 days
**When**: I generate a lagging indicators report
**Then**: I get a PDF report with trends showing:
- ✅ Architectural debt velocity
- ✅ Security incident reduction
- ✅ Maintainability improvements
- ✅ Development velocity impact

### ✅ Criterion 3: ROI Analysis Report
**Given**: Cost data and productivity metrics are available
**When**: I request an ROI analysis report
**Then**: I receive a detailed PDF showing:
- ✅ Calculated ROI with implementation costs vs cost avoidance
- ✅ Productivity gains
- ✅ Quality improvements

### ✅ Criterion 4: Scheduled Reports
**Given**: Scheduled report jobs are configured
**When**: Reports are set to run weekly/monthly
**Then**: PDF reports are automatically generated and made available for download without manual intervention

### ✅ Criterion 5: Email Notifications
**Given**: Stakeholder email preferences are configured
**When**: Scheduled reports complete successfully
**Then**: Stakeholders receive email notifications with download links for their reports

## Files Modified/Created
